I challenged myself to make something small and useful, I put a strict timebox around the work of 3 Hours.

Producing something new in a tight timeframe was an exercise in scoping. My original thoughts for the chrome extension were more feature rich, with multi-site and a settings panel built in react. 

In the end it's just a few lines of CSS that loads when you visit Linkedin.

Most of my time was spent learning the conventions and process for creating a chrome extension. I was only coding for about an hour, most of this time was getting the format correct for the manifest json file.
