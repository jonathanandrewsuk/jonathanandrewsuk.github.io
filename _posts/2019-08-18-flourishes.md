I'm guilty of occasionally jumping to front-end styling before all my bugs are fixed; it’s usually as a ‘treat’ and results in a burst of instant gratification.

It’s from my own bias that when I see time and effort put into the little things on the front, I assume that there must also be real quality of thought & effort beneath the HTML. I’m aware that’s not always the case, some people are out there making smokescreens for awkward legacy bakends.

Here’s a few flourishes I’ve noticed recently: 

## IndieHackers: Upvote Button

The like button on IndieHackers, I like that a little extra effort has been put into the mechanism for cheering other people on. That’s the whole spirit of the site distilled into a little button.

## Giphy: Power Glove

Giphy uploader animation, the nintendo power glove gives you a charming finder wag if you try to upload an incompatible file format. Their brand tone even makes its way into the user creation tools.

## Spotify: Stranger Things Mode

One of the most high profile examples I can think of is Spotify’s “Stranger Things Mode”, a google search will show you how widely appreciated and shared this was when it was shipped.

## Juno: Low Battery Status

This one isn't front end flash but more of flourishy feature, Juno allows passengers to let their driver know beforehand that they are running low on juice. Arguably if the driver has a charger to offer they are going to do it regardless, but it’s more the fact that someone has taken the time to push this little feature into production.

It is important to note that this sort of work needs to be done on top of a rock solid functional product. A bunch of flourishes won’t make up for a product with a lackluster core experience.
