I read about creating "moments of joy" for the user but this can sometimes reference a particularly good user journey or complete customer support flow. I see a flourish as being a smaller version of this, **a fleeting moment in which a product behaves in a pleasing way.**

> It’s from my own bias that when I see time and effort put into the little things on the front, I assume that there must also be real quality of thought & effort beneath the HTML.

(I’m aware that’s not always the case, some people are out there making smokescreens for awkward legacy bakends)

**Here’s a few flourishes I’ve noticed recently:**

## IndieHackers: Upvote Button

The like button on [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), I like that a little extra effort has been put into the mechanism for cheering other people on. That’s the whole spirit of the site distilled into a little button.

## Giphy: Power Glove

[Giphy](https://giphy.com/) uploader animation, the nintendo power glove gives you a charming finger wag if you try to upload an incompatible file format. Their brand tone even makes its way into the user creation tools.

## Spotify: Stranger Things Mode

One of the most high profile examples I can think of is Spotify’s “Stranger Things Mode”, a google search will show you how widely [appreciated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBQ0ZVrlJI) and shared this was when it was shipped.

## Juno: Low Battery Status

This one isn't front end flash but more of flourishy feature, [Juno](https://gojuno.com/) allows passengers to let their driver know beforehand that they are running low on juice. Arguably if the driver has a charger to offer they are going to do it regardless, but it’s more the fact that someone has taken the time to push this little feature into production.

**It is important to note that this sort of work needs to be done on top of a rock solid functional product. A bunch of flourishes won’t make up for a product with a lackluster core experience.**
