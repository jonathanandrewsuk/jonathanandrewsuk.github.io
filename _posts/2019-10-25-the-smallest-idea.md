## Coming up with an idea nugget 

Like anybody with a product idea, I’d love to be able to ship V1 in the fastest time possible. This nugget of an idea only takes a few moments to conceptualize but then other **thoughts of features, roadblocks and implementation details soon pile on top.**

I had the urge to make something, but couldn’t think of a small idea worth pursuing. I racked my brain for a full day, but nothing surfaced. Then in the evening I picked up a book I was halfway through. Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.

I was reading through a section on consumption habits and the amount of time spent scrolling aimlessly through feeds on certain sites. The feeds often aren’t focused on the utility of the site (Messaging, Sharing your own content etc), they are passively engaging streams of content. This passive engagement is shown to lead a drop in self worth and mental well being, our brains are wired to be social but not in this one sided nature. 

That's when the idea bubbled up, I wasn’t actively thinking about but somewhere in my subconscious that other thread of thought was triggered.

**A small idea is a chrome extension that removes the newsfeed elements from selected social networking sites.** 

In my naive moments thinking this idea was unique I quickly search for existing products… the product already exists in certain forms. My gut reaction was disappointment everyone believes their thoughts are unique, but as I explored the products further there are features and design that don’t yet exist.

So I’ll get to work making the simplest version possible that provides a foundation for expansion. Like many of these blog posts this a reminder to myself and anyone who stumbles across this page:
> Today’s reminder that the brain needs stimulation to generate new things, a life of routine is good in many ways but not optimal for ideas.
