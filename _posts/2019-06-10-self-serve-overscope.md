## What is the right size idea to tackle next?

I’ve been pushing hard at a software side project recently, trying to graduate it from my list of purchased domains and half done GitHub repos. During this time I’ve started to read [indiehackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/), there’s plenty of people telling the stories of their profitable side projects. It gives me a morale boost to see one person products that are successful because as I’ve learned there’s plenty of opportunities to make mistakes. 

The root cause of my mistakes is usually that I’ve gotten too excited and overscoped myself. The excitement is required to crunch through the amount of code you need to write, but it’s also the reason I could end up getting fatigued as my to-do list it far too long with too little gratifying moments built in.

**So from now on my personal sprint planning will always include things that I know will give me a morale boost.**

1.**Crossing off small daily tasks** - I didn’t used to track small tasks (like writing this blog post), but clicking “done” and watching the completed animation inside todoist is more powerful than I first thought.

2.**Purposely underestimating my free time**, ending up with more “earned” free time is always good.

3.**Sending my work out for feedback**, it’s just degrading if it’s sat on my hard drive.


I’ll obviously try to not overscope myself in the future, but at least by doing this, the grind will have pockets of happiness.
